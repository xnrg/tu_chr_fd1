    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>


These functions may be recursive:
	display_date()
	mx_date()

Making this function inlineable: sx_date()

Making this function inlineable: reset_date()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	clear_display_all()
	set_value()
	itoa()
	display_chars()
	switch_seg()
	display_symbol()
