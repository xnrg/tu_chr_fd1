These functions may be recursive:
	display_alarm()
	mx_alarm()
	stop_alarm()

Making this function inlineable: stop_alarm()

Making this function inlineable: reset_alarm()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	stop_buzzer()
	clear_display_all()
	set_value()
	display_symbol()
	convert_hour_to_12H_format()
	display_chars()
	itoa()
	switch_seg()
	display_am_pm_symbol()
